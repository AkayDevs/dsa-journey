# Codeforces Solutions

This directory contains my solutions to Codeforces problems, organized by contest division.

## Directory Structure

- `Div1/`: Problems from Division 1 contests
- `Div2/`: Problems from Division 2 contests
- `Educational/`: Problems from Educational Round contests

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the following format:
```
CF_<contest_number><problem_letter>_<problem_name>.<extension>
```

Example: `CF_750A_NewYearAndHurry.cpp` for Codeforces Round #750, Problem A "New Year and Hurry" solved in C++.

## Problem Template

Each solution file includes:

```
/**
 * Problem: <contest_number><problem_letter>. <problem_title>
 * Contest: Codeforces Round #<contest_number> (<division>)
 * Link: https://codeforces.com/contest/<contest_number>/problem/<problem_letter>
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(?)
 * Space Complexity: O(?)
