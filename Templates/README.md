# Competitive Programming Templates

This directory contains reusable code templates for competitive programming in various languages.

## Directory Structure

- `C++/`: Templates for C++ solutions
- `Python/`: Templates for Python solutions
- `Java/`: Templates for Java solutions

## Available Templates

### C++

- Basic template with common libraries and macros
- Data structures implementations (segment tree, trie, DSU, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- String algorithms (KMP, Z-algorithm, etc.)
- Number theory (prime sieve, modular arithmetic, etc.)

### Python

- Basic template with common libraries and macros
- Data structures implementations
- Graph algorithms
- String algorithms
- Number theory algorithms

### Java

- Basic template with fast I/O
- Data structures implementations
- Graph algorithms
- String algorithms
- Number theory algorithms

## Usage

Copy the appropriate template for your problem and modify as needed. These templates are designed to save time during competitive programming contests by providing common boilerplate code and algorithm implementations.
